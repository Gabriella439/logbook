_**no signal**_ is a [science fiction](science-fiction.md) escape room game about loneliness, fixing broken machinery, and reading old logs. You're stuck by yourself on a space station orbiting a black hole, trying to get home. There's no one to call for help.

The game is made in [Godot](godot.md).
