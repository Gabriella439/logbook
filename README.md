# logbook

This is my logbook, where notes are recorded and publicly shared at [github.com/exodrifter/logbook](https://github.com/exodrifter/logbook).

I'm a vtuber indie game developer who [livestreams](notes/live-streaming.md) game development. I love yuri, sci-fi, and heavy board games. If you like the work I do, there are [a few ways you can support me](notes/crowdfunding.md).
