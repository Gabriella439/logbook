# logbook

This is my logbook, where notes are recorded and publicly shared.

I'm a vtuber indie game developer who [streams](notes/streaming-activity.md) on [Twitch](notes/twitch.md). I love yuri, sci-fi, and heavy board games.

If you like the work I do, you can support me on [Ko-fi](notes/ko-fi.md) or [Patreon](notes/patreon.md).
