# logbook

This is my logbook, where I record notes about my [projects](indices/projects.md) and media that I consume as a way to make it easier to talk or write about them. I'm a vtuber indie game developer who [livestreams](notes/live-streaming.md) game development. I love yuri, sci-fi, and heavy board games. If you like the work I do, there are [a few ways you can support me](indices/crowdfunding.md).

These notes are hosted at [github.com/exodrifter/logbook](https://github.com/exodrifter/logbook).
