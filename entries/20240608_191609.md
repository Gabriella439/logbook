The Indie Fund is an [indie game fund](../notes/indie-game-funds.md) that is run by a collective of experienced game developers looking to encourage the next wave of game developers.

They don't publish the game, they cannot help with marketing, and they also don't take ownership of the IP. They just provide funding. Instead, each investor in the collective chooses for themselves if they'd like to participate or not.

Repayment works by applicants paying back the investment and then sharing 25% of the revenue until the initial investment is doubled or until 2 years after the initial launch date, whichever comes first. Any unpaid amount after 2 years of release are void.
