I posted about the [`AnimationPlayer`](../notes/godot-animation-player.md) [shader parameter interpolation problem](../notes/godot-animation-player-interpolation.md) on [t/suki](../notes/tsuki.md) and mentioned a few more details:

- The problem happens in [Godot](../notes/godot.md) 4.2.1
- You have to set _all_ key frames in _all_ animations in order for this workaround to work. When I first tried doing this, I found that the interpolation for my animation still wouldnâ€™t work because the `RESET` animation still had a key frame with null values.
