After using [Zettelkasten Notes](../notes/zettelkasten-note.md) and [Journals](../notes/journal.md), I have found it useful to create notes containing a summary of my current understanding of something followed by links to immutable notes showing how I have gotten to that understanding. I shall call these notes [Subject Notes](../notes/subject-note.md).
