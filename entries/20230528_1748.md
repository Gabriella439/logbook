It has occurred to me that my concepts of a [[meta/journal|Journal]] and a [[meta/development-journal|Development Journal]] are not very different from each other. The only difference is that a [[meta/development-journal|Development Journal]] focuses on the potential to troubleshoot an issue later, but that can just be seen as a [[meta/journal|Journal's]] particular focus. So, I'm going to combine the two concepts.
