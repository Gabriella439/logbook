Something I dislike about my [Zettelkasten Notes](../notes/zettelkasten-note.md) is that it's hard in Obsidian to easily open a Zettelkasten Note by pressing the hotkey for opening a file (`ctrl+o` by default) because all of the notes only contain a date and time.

This was a problem when I wanted to look at the Dharma Doujo note again (see [20230531_1447](20230531_1447.md)), but I haven't created a [Subject Note](../notes/subject-note.md) for it yet.

I briefly considered refactoring all of my [Zettelkasten Notes](../notes/zettelkasten-note.md) to have useful filenames, but I decided against it because I would like it to push myself to create [Subject Notes](../notes/subject-note.md) and treat [Zettelkasten Notes](../notes/zettelkasten-note.md) as atomic pieces of data used to create bigger notes.
