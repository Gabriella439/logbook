# `ScrollContainer` doesn't scroll with click and drag

In [Godot](godot.md), mouse and touch inputs are treated as separate inputs and by default, Godot will emulate mouse events with touch but not the other way around. To make [`ScrollContainer`](godot-scroll-container.md) elements scroll with mouse click and drag events, enable `Input Devices > Pointing > Emulate Touch From Mouse`.
